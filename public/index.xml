      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer from Salt Lake City, UT I am passionate about software that is actually what the customer wants and needs. To me, this means building software and architectures that are easily tested and deployed. This also means creating feedback loops and data from the customers as well as within the software process.
Currently, I am at MasterControl on the &amp;ldquo;System Team&amp;rdquo; working on the CI/CD Pipeline.
I Graduated from the University of Utah in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</description>

      <description>Hi there! Welcome to my first post.
This is the start of a new adventure in building some stuff and writing about it.
Finding Passion For the last little while since I have been out of school and have started working in a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job, I have been trying to figure out my place in this world of software. I guess in reflection, I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for what I am actually passionate about.</description>
