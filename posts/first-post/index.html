<p>This is the start of a new adventure in building some stuff and writing about it.</p>

<p>For the last little while since I have been out of school and have started working in a &ldquo;real&rdquo; job, I have been trying to figure out my place in this world of software.
I guess in reflection, I&rsquo;ve been searching for what I am actually passionate about.
In school I was incredibly interested in compilers, programming languages, and operating systems.
After being in the industry, I am still interested in those topics, but other things have caught my eye.
I am now incredibly fascinated with the idea of building highly-scalable, cloud-based software that can be deployed easily and focuses on the customer.</p>
<h3 id="first-team">First Team<a href="#first-team" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>The first team that I was on in MasterControl was a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; team working on the Manufacturing product.
We built features for the product in Spring and Angular.
It was a great learning experience in MVC web applications and software development process.
I had an amazing mentor on the team that really took me under his wing and I felt that I came up to speed really quickly because of this.</p>
<p>After getting the lay of the land and getting a little more comfortable, I started to feel like something was missing.
While the team that I worked on was great, the process in my company for integrating code and releasing to customers felt&hellip; disconnected.</p>
<p>I started reading articles and books about modern software practices and what we were doing didn&rsquo;t seem that close to these ideals.
While reading the DevOps Handbook, I started feeling the urge to be apart of this &ldquo;movement&rdquo;.
But when talking to those around me, I started to feel more alone, not many people seemed to care too much about these &ldquo;ideals&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="helping-on-the-pipeline">Helping On The Pipeline<a href="#helping-on-the-pipeline" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of a PI (my company follows SAFe) last year, my team was asked to help out with the System Team for a couple of sprints.
This initiative was to move our existing pull request pipeline that ran on local hardware up to AWS.
I was extremely excited, finally I was able to get more hands on experience with something downstream of the features I was building.</p>
<p>The two sprints that we helped out was a whirlwind, but I loved it.
It was a rush to move everything up to the new environment because the current pipeline was burning down on slower local hardware.
But even though it was hectic, I felt at home solving these problems.</p>
<h3 id="moving-to-the-system-team">Moving to the System Team<a href="#moving-to-the-system-team" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>After our short time helping on the pipeline migration we went back to our normal work.
After a couple of sprints being back, I started to think about the experience a lot.
I really enjoyed the time working on those problems and I got a little bit of a better understanding of how my code moves down the stream.</p>
<p>When I heard that the System Team was looking to grow, I reached out to their manager to talk about it and get more information.
At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do because I was so new in the industry and wasn&rsquo;t really sure which direction I wanted to go.
Also, I was a little nervous that the new position would require a lot more time commitment than my current position.
After some talks with the System Team manager and my wife, I decided to move to the System Team.</p>
<p>That was one of the best decisions I have made.</p>
<h3 id="being-a-pipeline-peep">Being a Pipeline Peep<a href="#being-a-pipeline-peep" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>Being on the System Team (we call ourselves the Pipeline Peeps), has been an amazing journey.
I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people I have met, and I&rsquo;ve been right in the middle of everything in development at MasterControl.</p>
<p>This experience has given me a little more clarity on what I am passionate about in this industry.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve made it through this, I want to thank you.
It&rsquo;s probably not that interesting of stuff to anyone other than me.</p>
<p>But honestly, this blog is kinda mostly for me.
I have a desire to build things to mess around with things that interest me.
And I want to write about them.
If you find any of the things I post interesting, than that&rsquo;s just a bonus!!</p>
