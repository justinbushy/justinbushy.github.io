### Current Projects

[Calendar-API](https://github.com/justinbushy/node-calendar-api) - REST API written in Node.js with a MongoDB datastore. The purpose of this API is to create flexible calendar functionality with events, todo lists, and sharing between users. The original purpose was to make sharing appointments between my wife and I easier.  

[Sprite Editor](https://github.com/justinbushy/SpriteEditor) - Application to create animated sprites written in C++/Qt. This was a project built by a team I was apart of for Software Practice II at the University of Utah.
